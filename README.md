## ⚡ Fun Fact
I enjoy improving developer workflows and occasionally explore AI to automate repetitive engineering tasks.

---

### ✍ How to use
1. Create a repo named exactly like your GitHub username (e.g., `anoop-tiwari`).  
2. Add this `README.md` to that repo's root and commit. GitHub will render it on your profile.  
3. Replace placeholder links (LinkedIn, GitHub username) with your real links for live badges & stats.

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Replace placeholders with your real GitHub username and LinkedIn link (I used sensible defaults).  
- Add animated SVG counters, a projects gallery with thumbnails, or a downloadable CV link.  
- Generate a ready-to-upload `README.md` file and a `.png` hero image for your profile.

Want me to **replace the placeholders now** and produce the final file ready for upload? (I’ll do it in this reply — no waiting.)
